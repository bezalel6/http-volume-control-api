# Audio Service Implementation Notes

## Key Points

### 1. Device Detection is Correct
The original implementation using `"Default=Render"` filter is **correct**:
- It filters for devices where the `Default` column equals `"Render"` (output devices)
- The device marked with `Name=DefaultRenderDevice` is identified as the default
- This approach properly gets the current default audio output device

### 2. Whitelist Implementation Fix
The whitelist filtering has been improved:
- Instead of trying to build complex GetNir filter expressions with paths
- We now get ALL applications first, then filter in JavaScript
- This supports both exact path match and process name match
- More reliable and easier to debug

### 3. Key Understanding
- `svcl.exe` outputs CSV format (comma-separated with quotes)
- `GetNir.exe` outputs TSV format (tab-separated)
- The "Name" column contains role identifiers like "DefaultRenderDevice"
- The "Device Name" column contains the actual device name

## Debug Commands

To understand what's happening:

```bash
# See raw output
binaries\svcl.exe /scomma ""

# See filtered devices
binaries\svcl.exe /scomma "" | binaries\GetNir.exe "Device Name,Name,Volume Percent,Default" "Default=Render"

# Test volume control
binaries\svcl.exe /SetVolume "chrome.exe" 50
```

## Debug Mode

Enable debug logging in `.env`:
```
AUDIO_DEBUG=true
```

This will log all commands and their outputs to help diagnose issues.
